        I am Ricardo Tanguan Macagba Jr. born august 14, 1990, in sampaguita village, San Pedro Laguna City. My mother
        raised me in cebu City until I was 4 years old, and when my dad decided to get us in san fernando city, La
        Union, they started to send me to Lingsat Community School in Barangay Lingsat.
        I remember when I was in my Elementary days. I am so shy, like a shy boy, I don't even talk to anybody and I
        like being alone. But in my 4rth grade everything changed. I started to play with my classmates and make
        friends, play with them, till grade 5. I remember every time we had a vacant, we started to play, even after
        school. we go home like we've been fighting pirates and Vikings, we are so tired and smell like a fighter. and
        of course what do we expect from our parents, of course they're so mad. but what else they can do, nothing but
        to pardon the child they love.
        Grade 6 is different, here comes puppy love. I don't know anything bout love, crushes, none at all, all I do is
        play and play. but here's the thing, some girls are always sending me love letters, some others buy me food, and
        give me gifts. I remember that one girl cried on me because I didn't read her letter. Instead I throw it in the
        trash can. I also become Mr. Intramurals.
        First year high school in Christ the King College (CKC), the worst year in my high school days. All I want is to
        play, laugh with my friends/ classmates and go outside and roam with them. It’s like I carry the elementary days
        in me. And the sad thing is my grades become praying mantis, or “Wasay-Wasay”. And they want me to summer my
        Math subject because it failed. Here comes the good part and most exciting part of my life ever. When I summer
        my Math subject in La Union National High School (LUNHS). That time I was so scared because of the rumors that
        some students are crazy, like they always fight with each other, the school has gangs, fraternities, vices,
        crazy teachers. But my parents want me to enroll in that school, so I don't have a choice but to follow them. I
        passed my summer class and enrolled myself in that school. At first I was shocked because the rumor is true. On
        the first day of class, students went wild. I feel danger anywhere, but I've found out that all my friends in
        elementary school enrolled in that school. When I saw them, I felt a lil bit comfortable and a lil bit happy.
        They taught me everything that I should know to stay alive or to stay longer in that school. What I didn't know
        is that, it is not about surviving in school, but to survive in real life, to survive in any situation in life.
        To become stronger and to be more brave at decision making. My High school days taught me what life really is.

        Now in College, I didn’t finish first year first semester because of my own emotion. I see my family breaking
        apart and I begin to make my own decision in life. I tell myself that I need to go far away from my family, I
        don’t want to see them fighting. So I decided to find a job, And I saw one, just in front of our family house,
        very far, right? I have worked as a computer shop attendant for I think three to four years. After that year of
        computer literate, I decided to look for a new career and many of my “Ka-babata” is in music industry and they
        taught me everything so that i can start my career as a raper. Many years passed and nothing happened. We didn’t
        even pass the grammys. I mean the Philippine music award. But we have plenty of supporters. Until once again I
        felt bored in that career so I decided again to look for something else that I might fall in love with. But
        nothing. So I decided to stop and go back to where I belong. I went home, and bad things happened, my father
        died. And more problems have come but I didn’t go away, I stayed with my family. Until I realise that family is
        more important than anything else. So many lessons I learned while I was away. Years passed and I decided again
        to find a job, Until my aunt asked me if I wanted to go back to school once again, and I accepted it. And here I
        am a second year college student as an I.T.
